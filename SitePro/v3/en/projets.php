        <h3> Creation of a website </h3>
        <p> This very website was created by me as part of the IDAW course during my studies at IMT North Europe. </p>
        <h3> "Streinger Town" </h3>
        <p> In the Open Project UV, I taught C programming classes to middle school students from André Streinger
            <br>College in Douai, with the aim of building an autonomous car with the students.
        </p>
        <h3> CAPA 2023 (Comité d'Accueil des Premiers Arrivants) </h3>
        <p> In September 2023, I participated in welcoming the new class of engineering students at the Douai
            <br> campus of IMT North Europe.
